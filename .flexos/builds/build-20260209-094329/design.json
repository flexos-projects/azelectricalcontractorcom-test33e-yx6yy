        "current": "Generic sans-serif fonts, heavy use of all caps for headings and main text elements.",

Awe at the dynamic, intelligent design; trust in Westgate's expertise and reliability; and inspired confidence that their home's electrical needs, no matter how complex or visionary, are in the most capable hands. The site should evoke a feeling of sophisticated power and effortless control.",

      ]
    },
    "layoutConcepts": {
      "heroApproach": "A 'Kinetic Energy Field' hero. Instead of a static image, the hero features a dynamic, abstract particle system or subtle GLSL shader animation that subtly pulses and flows, reminiscent of electrical currents or data transfer. This visual is overlaid with a stark, bold, animated typography reveal of 'WESTGATE ENTERPRISES: Powering Modern Living.' Interactive elements (e.g., a subtle magnetic effect on the primary CTA) invite engagement. The logo is subtly integrated into the top navigation, not overlapping the hero visually.",
      "sectionTransitions": "Sections will transition using a combination of 'morphing wipes' and 'depth parallax'. As the user scrolls, the background of the current section might subtly warp or shift color, revealing the next section through a smooth, organic wipe. Key elements (e.g., headings, imagery) within the incoming section will emerge with a slight delay and a subtle 3D parallax effect, creating a sense of layered depth and continuous flow. For major thematic shifts, a full-screen, short animation (e.g., a stylized 'spark' or 'circuit trace') could act as a separator.",
      "gridStrategy": "An 'Asymmetric Narrative Grid' will be employed. Content blocks will not adhere to a rigid uniform grid but will instead be composed in an intentionally unbalanced, yet harmonious, manner. Overlapping elements (images peeking from behind text blocks, subtle gradients extending beyond their containers, text boxes partially obscuring adjacent elements) will create visual tension and dynamism. This allows for creative compositions that guide the eye through a visual story, breaking the monotony of traditional layouts while maintaining readability.",
      "whitespacePhilosophy": "Whitespace is treated as a premium design element, not just empty space. It is used dramatically to create breathing room, emphasize key content, and establish a sense of modern luxury and precision. Large, intentional negative spaces will frame critical information or impactful visuals, drawing the user's attention. This 'generous' whitespace prevents visual clutter and allows the bold typography and animations to truly shine, conveying a sense of sophistication and clarity.",
      "scrollExperience": "The scroll experience is a 'Guided Discovery Journey'. As the user scrolls, the page transforms into a narrative. Elements will animate into view with purpose (not just fades). Horizontal scrolling sections might be introduced for showcasing portfolio projects or service tiers, breaking the vertical rhythm. Sticky elements (e.g., a progress indicator, a call-to-action button that transforms) will provide constant orientation and engagement. Subtle background shifts and interactive elements (e.g., a 'smart home' graphic that illuminates features as you scroll past) will keep the user immersed."

Accent color `#3498DB` remains consistent for impact, but its intensity might be slightly desaturated to prevent eye strain on a dark background, ensuring it still pops without being overly harsh.
